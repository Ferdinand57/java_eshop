When i implement all the requested feature, i make sure to use descriptive name to all of the functions name. I also make sure to limit function to a small size and make sure they only do as little thing as they can. To make sure my code easy to read, i also make sure to use consistent formatting on all my files. To make sure my function is secure, i also use POST for modifying data like delete and edit feature instead of GET. And to make my code more secure i also added several error handling, such as making sure when the delete button is pressed without any of the checkboxes is check, it will do nothing.
