My strategy was pretty straightforward, I went through the PMD reports, and I addressed the issues one by one, starting with the easiest ones. I tried to understand what each rule meant and then made the necessary changes to the code to fix the violation. I made sure to commit each fix separately, as per the exercise rule.

I think the current implementation is a good start for CI/CD, but it's not fully there yet. The CI part is pretty solid, since the workflow automatically runs tests on every push to the main branch. However, the deployment part is still manual, since I have to manually merge the code to the main branch. To achieve true Continuous Deployment, the workflow should automatically deploy the code to Koyeb after the tests pass.
